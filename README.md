This is a simple python script that replaces your desktop background with xddwindow, and replaces your shortcut icon to xdd.ico

That's literally all it does.

There is a .exe file in here, Window will either flag it as trojan or won't. If you find it too sussy, you can compile the source code yourself. 

Window defender has a raging booner against py exe or something I have no idea.
